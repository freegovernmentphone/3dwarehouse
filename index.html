        <h2>How The Program Works</h2>
        <p>Free government phone programs help people stay connected to family, work, school, and health services. The most common options are Lifeline and the Affordable Connectivity Program. Providers that join these programs offer discounted or free service, many also supply a device. Plans usually include calls, texts, and mobile data. Exact benefits change by state and by provider rules.</p>
        <p>Apply through an approved provider that serves your zip code. You share proof of identity and eligibility. The provider checks your details, then ships a phone or a SIM card. Activation steps are included in the box. Most users are active shortly after approval. Read all terms, since some plans include optional add ons that cost money.</p>
        <p>The purpose is access, not luxury. That means a reliable phone, basic monthly data, and stable coverage. These basics support daily life. They also improve safety during weather alerts and emergencies. If you need more data, ask about upgrades. Compare offers before you choose one.</p>

      <!-- Guide 2 -->
      <article id="guide-2">
        <h2>Eligibility And Documents</h2>
        <p>Most applicants qualify by income level or by enrollment in a public benefit. Income rules use federal poverty guidelines. A second path is proof that you receive SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, or similar aid. Tribal programs may provide enhanced help. Check your provider page for the full list.</p>
        <p>Gather clean documents before you start. You will need a government ID, proof of address, and proof of income or benefits. Take clear photos in good light. Crop out background. Make sure names and addresses match across all files. Blurry uploads and mismatched details are common reasons for delays.</p>
        <p>Create a short checklist. Include your full name, date of birth, the last four digits of SSN if asked, your current address, and an email that you can access daily. Keep copies of every file and every confirmation email. If the provider asks for more proof, reply fast. Quick replies prevent your case from stalling.</p>

        <div class="note">Use the same email during the whole process. It helps with tracking updates.</div>

      <article id="guide-3">
        <h2>Application Tips And Common Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Complete every field on the form. Enter your data exactly as it appears on your ID. Match the postal format for your address. If a letter has two sides, upload both sides. Update your address before you apply if you have moved. Small errors can trigger a manual review, which slows approval.</p>
        <p>Take time with document photos. Use high resolution. Make sure names, dates, and case numbers are easy to read. Save files as JPG or PDF. Most providers accept those formats. If a file is large, compress it without harming text quality.</p>
        <p>After approval, track the shipment and save the tracking number. When the device arrives, check all items in the box. Insert the SIM if needed, then follow the activation steps. If activation fails, contact support with your order number and approval email. Set a lock code, update the device, and store important contacts. Watch for recertification texts or emails and respond on time.</p>
